Welcome to my personal website
-------


My name is Karl. I am a Astrophysics Ph.D (Aug-2023) from Vanderbilt University who is pivoting to industry. I decided that my route going forward would not continue in academia as I want my work to contribute to more material improvements in society other than the theoretical understanding of the Universe around us. I would like to go into data science amongst various industries such as Healthcare, Commerce, and Transportation, to name a few. 

I've developed an extensive background in data science during graduate school. My research has primarily focused on developing automated machine-learning frameworks to download, process, and analyze gigabytes of multi-dimensional astronomical measurements from both ground and space based instruments. My statistical background encompasses both frequentist statistics as well as Bayesian statistics in order to better propogate uncertainties through my analyses. My dissertation was primarily centered on analyses I performed using Python 3. I have also developed expertise in SQL for querying, and various data visualization packages such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and plotly. 

I believe in continuous learning and have been teaching myself other frameworks such as Tensorflow and PySpark, newer machine-learning technologies such as Transformers and Large Language Models and additional visualization packages like Tableau and Dash so I can tell more stories with data. My blog on this website will serve as a self-chronolog of that learning journey. I hope you learn something today as well!

I am excited about advances in AI but I am also keen on contributing to the ethical application of AI in all its forms. I am committed to developing AI ethically. I believe it's crucial to develop AI with the sensitivity and attention to avoiding the harmful impacts on marginalized communities. I am eager to collaborate with others and learn from diverse perspectics to ensure the technologies we create are inclusive and respectful to all communities. 

When I am not doing work I will usually do some embroidery on a loop or on my converses if I'm not reading or listening to a book. Sometimes I will be chasing around one (or both) of my two cats, Harry and Vera. Enjoy all their fluffy stillness when they're not zooming around in goblin-mode in the photos below.
