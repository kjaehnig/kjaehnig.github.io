I taught of a small cohort of undergraduates (N=25-30) for the spring semester in observational astronomy methods. This included twice a week laboratory instruction where we covered topics such as:

* Classification of stars
* Phases of the Moon
* Solar Chemistry
* Stellar Evolution

There was also a once a week observational laboratory where I would take my class to the top of a Vanderbilt parking garage and setup 10-15 8in reflector telescopes to teach both the mechanical aspects of astronomy observations, as well as giving the students hands-on experience with night-sky observing. This was extremely beneficial to the students as it helped them gain a first-hand appreciation for the night sky.
