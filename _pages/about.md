Welcome to my personal website
-------

I am Karl(i) and I am a recent Astrophysics Ph.D (Aug-2023) from Vanderbilt University who is pivoting to industry. I've developed an extensive background in data-science during my astrophysics research. I've developed frameworks to process hundreds of gigabytes of both ground-based and space-based astrophysical measurements to resolve unanswered questions in the field of astronomy. I've developed multiple skills in Bayesian statistics and performing Bayesian inference to propogate measurement uncertainties to produce reliable conclusions as well as the confidence of those conclusions. I am a continuous learner and have been teaching myself more concepts in data-science to expand my capabilities as a data scientist. My blog on this website will serve as a self-chronolog of that learning journey. I hope you learn something today as well!

I am excited about advances in AI but I am also keen on contributing to the ethical application of AI in all its forms. I am committed to developing AI ethically. I believe it's crucial to develop AI with the sensitivity and attention to avoiding the harmful impacts on marginalized communities. I am eager to collaborate with others and learn from diverse perspectics to ensure the technologies we create are inclusive and respectful to all communities. 

When I am not doing work I will usually do some embroidery on a loop or on my converses if I'm not reading. I'll either be doing that or chasing around one (or both) of my two cats, Harry and Vera. Partake in their fluffy stillness when they're not zooming around in goblin-mode.
