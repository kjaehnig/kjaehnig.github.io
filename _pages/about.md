Welcome to my personal website
-------

I am Karl(i) and I am a recent Astrophysics Ph.D (Aug-2023) from Vanderbilt University who is pivoting to industry. My background is data-science oriented as much of my astrophysics research was driven with machine-learning algorithms to process gigabytes of astrophysical data. I have currently been teaching myself more advanced concepts in data-science to expand my capabilities as a data scientist. The blog on this website will **hopefully** serve as a self-chronolog of that learning journey.
