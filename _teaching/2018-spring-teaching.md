I taught of a small cohort of undergraduates (N=25-30) for the spring semester in observational astronomy methods. This included twice a week laboratory instruction where we covered topics such as:

* Classification of stars
* Phases of the Moon
* Solar Chemistry
* Stellar Evolution

There was also a once a week observational laboratory where I would take my class to the top of a Vanderbilt parking garage and setup 10-15 8in reflector telescopes to teach both the mechanical aspects of astronomy observations, as well as giving the students hands-on experience with night-sky observing. This was extremely beneficial to the students as it helped them gain a first-hand appreciation for the night sky.

While the downtown Nashville light polution was ever present near Vanderbilt, it was still possible to get some amazing images on these telescopes with phone cameras if you positioned them just right. This was extremely popular with my students as it bridged the separation between seeing astronomical images put out by space-telescopes or research publications and instead seeing these wonderous celestial bodies with your own eyes. In addition to making out the rings of Saturn it was possible to catch the 4 Galilean moons of Jupiter. My students were a bit surprised to find that the Moon through a telescope is **VERY** bright.
