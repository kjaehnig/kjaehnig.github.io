Nashville was the largest city to be under the path of complete totality during the August 17th 2017 solar eclipse (where the moon completely obscures the sun, causing immediate drops in temperature). This was a beautiful sight to behold, but it requires a lot of safety measures which needed to be communicated to the public effectively to prevent injury, and as an astronomer, I will just reiterate here for good measure: **Don't stare at the sun without the apropriate protective eye gear**. 

The Vanderbilt department of Physics & Astronomy developed an informative 1hr power point that covered the basics of the why Solar eclipses occur, and more importantly, how to safely observe them using direct protective measures such as solar eclipse rated glasses, or indirect methods such as a camera obscura. I was among the people who volunteered to go to different places such as a workplaces in Nashville and the schools in the Nashville-Davidson area that reached out to our department's announcement for preparations.
