I joined AI4ALL earlier this January as a part-time AI/ML instructor for
their spring semester, from late January to late April. AI4ALL focuses on
teaching ethical/responsible AI to minority under-graduates who want to
potentially seek out a career in AI. Ethical/responsible AI is a set of 
concepts and guidelines to both:

- Develop and deploy AI/ML systems that will not increase systematic
biases in society.
- Mitigate the biases currently present and reinforced by AIs that have
been deployed negligently.
