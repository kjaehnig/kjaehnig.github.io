Actually kinda nervous about this. 

This coming week I begin teaching with AI-4-all as an AI/ML instructor to under-represented minority undergraduates. The course is meant to be 50:50 technical course instruction, as well as discussion and exploration of ethical implications for different AI technologies. I am excited to start of course, because this is truly something I can have direct impact in. But I am also just nervous about screwing it up.
