											<h2>Autoencoder for Fraud Detection</h2>
											<p>Literally a needle in a haystack costing billions of dollars</p>
											<ul class="meta">
												<li class="icon fa-clock">November 20, 2023</li>
											</ul>
										</header>

										<p> This is part of a data science challenge project I have undertaken as part of the <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/data-skills-for-all" style="color: #8ebf42">Correlation-One Data Skills for All</a> bootcamp that I started back in October. I enjoy how well structured the bootcamp is to simulate industry specific projects to bolster professional skills in data science.
										</p>

										<p> Credit card fraud, despite constituting less than 1% of all transactions, cost consumers more than $8.8 billion dollars in 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. At least 26% of adults in the United States were affected by fraudulent transactions, with estimated losses over $180 million dollars a year.
										</p>

										<p> I took part in the data scientist section of this data challenge, which was to build a machine learning model that could effectively discriminate between fraudulent transactions and legitimate transactions. Before I could do that, I needed to analyze the 3 data sets that I was provided for insights. Then I had to clean the datasets for quality assurance, and perform data engineering to construct features. These features would then be scaled and fed to models that can best separate legitimate transactions from fraudulent transactions.  
										</p>

										<p> The three datasets are credit card fraud datasets from Kaggle that have been filtered to only contain transactions from 2016 - 2019 for 2000 customers. 

											<ol>
												<li>Credit Card Customer Data (2000 rows x 18 columns)</li>
												<li>Credit Card per Customer Data (6146 rows x 13 columns)</li>
												<li>Credit Card Transaction Data (6,877,837 rows x 15 columns)</li>
											</ol>	

										The sizes of the transaction data proved to be a little troublesome to operate with in a jupyter notebook as it regularly crashed my python kernel until I remembered to run the notebook with plenty of extra memory which avoided the issue entirely. I found that keeping track of memory usage and converting data types to reduce memory usage sped up the subsequent analyses consierably.
										</p>

										<p> The credit card customer dataset contains some demographic information such as location, gender, birth year, and some financial information like yearly-income, total debt, and FICO scores.
										</p>

										<p> The credit card per customer dataset has multiple rows for each customer listing out each individual credit card in their name. Also included are financial details such as credit limit and credit card PINs and meta data such as the number of times a card has been reissued (due to loss, damage, theft, etc.).
										</p>

										<p> The transactions dataset is the largest, containing all of the individual transaction assigned to each customer's identity. It contains a Fraud column that labels each transaction as fraudulent or legitimate. There are only about ~8400 fraudulent transactions among the 6 million rows of legitimate transactions. 
										</p>

										<p>Data analysis consisted of exploring the columns of each dataset as well as joining the customer and credit card datasets to the "main" transaction dataset to better see what features can be engineered to best train a model. Some of the figures from that analysis are below.
										</p>

The legitimate transactions are plotted in black, the fraudulent transaction in orange, with a trend line for each overplotted in cyan and red, respectively.'/>

										</figure>
										</center>

										<p>Figure 1 above shows the legitimate transaction amounts plotted by their 24 HR time of occurence as well as the occurence and amounts for all of the fraudulent transactions. The data itself doesn't give us much insight, but the rolling median trend lines for each set show some structure. The legitimate transactions show a near a constant trend of amount spent across the entire 24 HR time range, whereas the rolling median amount for the fraudulent transactions shows more activity in the early morning hours and has more variation overall than the legitimate transactions. This quantitative information can be useful to a model to sus out differing characteristics between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

										<p>Figure 2 shows a bar plot of the total number of transactions grouped first by the credit card company that issued the card used in the transaction: Amex, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa, and secondly splits the total number of transactions into a legit number and fraudulent number. Fraudulent transactions appear to occur more frequently with Mastercard and Visa, moreso than the relative scale of the legitimate transactions between all four card companies. Categorical data like this is useful to a machine learning model to better identify fraudulent transactions.

										<p>Figure 3 is a bar plot showing the total amount of transactions at the city, zip, and state level and whether the customer and merchant location at that level match. Furthermore the bars are split into legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Fraudulent transactions appear to take place more frequently outside of the customer's location at all 3 levels, with the biggest difference at the city, and zip-code level. The state level doesn't display as much difference in the number of fraudulent transactions when the state location doesn't match as opposed to when it does. These features were engineered by me from the categorical columns in the dataset and can serve as custom categorical features for a model to train on.

										<p>Figure 4 is a geographic map plot of the United States illustrating major areas of fraudulent transactions in red triangles, sized by the sum total amount of money involved in the fraudulent transactions. This figure shows that major metropolitan areas on both coast lines, as well in some inlying ares like Chicago, Illinois and Dallas, Texas. It would be too involved to train a machine learning model to consider geographic locations to try and separate out fraudulent transactions. However boolean features as to whether the customer and merchant locations match at different levels can provide the same amount of information without needing a geographic context in a model. This figure was exported from tableau and is available to interact with in a dashboard in my <a href="../projects/data_and_visualizations.html" style="color: #ffff00">Data and Visualizations</a> project page.
